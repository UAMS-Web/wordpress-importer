name: handed-back-label
description: >-
  The `handed-back` label a local CI gate puts on a pull request it sends back, and the
  GitHub Actions workflow that removes it when the pull request is pushed to or its
  description is edited by a person. Ships the
  workflow as a template to copy to `.github/workflows/clear-handed-back.yml`, and a drift
  check that fails when a repository's copy differs from the template or is missing.
  Activate when adding the workflow to a repository, changing it, wiring the drift check
  into a pre-merge check, or working out why a pull request still carries `handed-back`
  after a push.

# The `handed-back` label

A gate that finds a defect comments its verdict on the pull request and applies the `handed-back` label. The label says a finding is outstanding, so the queue counts `open AND not labelled`. A push to the pull request is it re-entering the queue, and a person editing its description is the other moment the label comes off: a finding in the description is addressed by editing it. A workflow does the removal, not the gate and not the author: a removal somebody has to remember gets missed, and a pull request still carrying the label drops out of the queue count for good.

What the gate does on a red verdict, and why it applies a label rather than flipping the pull request to draft, belongs to the `pre-merge-check` rule. This skill carries only the workflow and the check that keeps every copy of it the same.

## The workflow

`templates/clear-handed-back.yml` is the one shared copy:

- It runs on `pull_request` `synchronize` (the push) and `edited` (a description change). Opening a pull request, applying the label and commenting cannot remove it.
- An `edited` event removes the label only when both hold: the body changed (`github.event.changes.body` is present, which a title-only or base-branch edit does not carry), and the actor is not a bot (`github.event.sender.type != 'Bot'`). A bot rewrites descriptions too, a footer check for one, and that must not clear a finding nobody addressed. A push clears the label whoever made it.
- **A description edit on a pull request handed back for its code clears the label too.** The workflow cannot tell which part the finding was about. The gate's re-check finds the head unchanged since the hand-back and hands it back again without re-running the jobs (`pre-merge-check`, *A finding in the description alone*), so the cost is one comment and a label that comes back.
- A job-level `if:` skips it unless the pull request carries `handed-back`, so a push to any other pull request starts no runner and spends no minutes.
- It removes that one label with a single `DELETE /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/labels/handed-back` under the job's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, leaving every other label in place. A `200` or a `404` (the label is already gone) is success with no further call. Any other status is read against the label set instead of being taken as the verdict: the step lists the pull request's labels and passes when `handed-back` is absent (logging the status it saw), fails when the label is still present, and fails when the list cannot be read, since GitHub has answered `500` for a call whose write had landed.
- It is gated on `RUN_REMOTE_CI` like the rest of CI: the job condition starts with `vars.RUN_REMOTE_CI != 'false'`, so a private repository with the variable set to `false` skips it and bills no minutes. A skipped run removes nothing: while the switch is off, a push or a description edit leaves `handed-back` in place until a run with the switch on.

The job runs under its own token, so a `.claude/settings.json` that denies `gh api -X DELETE` to the gate's sessions does not reach it.

## Copying it into a repository

The sync delivers this skill under `.claude/` and `.agents/` and creates no workflow under `.github/`, so a repository copies the workflow once, in its own reviewed pull request (after that, the sync keeps an existing copy current, see *To change the workflow* below):

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp .claude/skills/handed-back-label/templates/clear-handed-back.yml .github/workflows/clear-handed-back.yml
```

Use exactly that path. A repository that already has the workflow under another name replaces that file rather than adding a second one, or two jobs race to remove the same label.

## The drift check

Nothing keeps the copy and the template together after that: a hand edit to the copy, or a template change the copy never received, goes unnoticed. The check notices:

```bash
node .claude/skills/handed-back-label/scripts/check-handed-back-workflow.mjs
```

- **Exit 0**: `.github/workflows/clear-handed-back.yml` is identical to the template.
- **Exit 1**: the copy differs (the first differing line is named) or is missing. Both paths are printed. A differing copy that runs on `edited` without the body condition or the actor condition also gets an `Unsafe:` line per missing condition, because that edit does harm rather than merely drifting. A copy that stops at `synchronize` is only different, and the first differing line says so.
- **Exit 2**: the check could not run: the template is unreadable, or the arguments are wrong.

Line endings are compared as LF, so a Windows checkout with `core.autocrlf` passes an otherwise identical copy. Every other byte counts. The repository root defaults to the top of the git checkout the command runs in; `--root <dir>` names another.

**Run it in the repository's pre-merge check**, so drift fails before merge rather than being found later. With the shared runner, a job in `local-ci.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "handed-back-workflow",
    "run": "node .claude/skills/handed-back-label/scripts/check-handed-back-workflow.mjs",
    "always": true
}
```

Give it no `requires`: the runner reports a job whose `requires` path is absent as skipped, with exit 0, and a missing check has to fail instead.

**To change the workflow**, change the template in `UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills`, under `shared/`, and copy it into `.github/workflows/clear-handed-back.yml` in that same pull request (this repository carries the workflow too). Nothing more is needed for the target repositories:

- **The sync copies it.** When a sync delivers a changed template to a target that already has `.github/workflows/clear-handed-back.yml`, it rewrites that file in the same commit with the whole template, the comment block between `name:` and `on:` included, so a header correction reaches the copy too. A target without the file gets no `.github/` file, and a copy already matching is not touched. The sync pull request therefore carries the template and its copy together, and the drift check passes on it. A rebuilt sync branch carries the copy again, with no manual commit.
- **The sync App needs the `workflows` permission to push it.** GitHub refuses a push that changes a file under `.github/workflows/` from an App without that permission. The `uams-claude-skills-sync` App is registered with `contents` (write), `metadata` (read) and `pull_requests` (write) only, so until the repository owner adds `workflows` (write) and accepts it on the installation, a sync that must change a copy fails for that target with a message naming the permission, and pushes nothing (the target's other updates in that sync wait too, because the push is one branch). A copy edited by hand is rewritten the same way, so it also needs the permission. Until then, fall back to the old way for that target: copy the template the sync pull request delivers over the workflow as a one-file commit on the sync branch, and run the drift check again before merging.
- **A repository's own pull request still fails the check from the other side.** It copies the new template into `.github/` while `.claude/skills/handed-back-label/templates/` still holds the old one, and neither pull request can merge first. Change the template at the source and let the sync bring both.

The fallback commit is lost when a later sync rebuilds the branch (the sync pushes it with `--force-with-lease`), so redo it on the rebuilt branch. It goes away once the App holds the permission.
